# FAQ's

## Common Issues:
- **Black screen when taking images** - Try changing the resolution, there is a chance that your camera may not support your current resolution
- **Time-lapses are jittery (see [first test]())** - Try turning the "Capture Delay" up a little bit, note that you need to account for the longer capture in the gcode by allowing enough time to capture the frame
- **Software takes a single image and then doesn't take another** - Try lowering the sensitivity, have a look at the "Viewer" and make sure that the sensitivity is higher than the change value when the software should not be taking an image
- **Software keeps taking pictures over and over again** - Try increasing the sensitivity, have a look at the "Viewer" and make sure that the sensitivity is lower than the change value when the software should be taking an image
