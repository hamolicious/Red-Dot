# Red-Dot
Red-Dot is a 100% free, hardware-less 3D printing time-lapse software that utilises the camera to detect when to take the picture to make those awesome "growing" time-lapses

## Some things that I want to change:
- [ ] Increase the resolution from 640x480 to at least HD
- [ ] Increase the customisability of the software such as paths and themes
- [ ] Add a normal timelapse feature
